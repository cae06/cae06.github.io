        <h3>Mythology Surrounding Shipwrecks!</h3>
        <p>Throughout the history of the human race, the sea has always stirred terror and awe into people.
          This terror is due to the oceans vast,uncharted depths which give rise to tales of mystery, myth and misfortune for sailors.
          old sailors would whisper of old ghostly shiops drifting across a silent ocean billowing with curses of the drowned sailors.
          Legends speak of the <span class="highlight">Flying Dutchmen</span>, doomed to sail forever in the unforgiving ocean.
          Legends also talk of <span class="highlight">Sirens</span>. These are half woman/half creature that would sing songs so haunting that they would lure entire crews of sailors into watery graves.
          The ocean was not just for exploration but a stage for magical supernatural things to occur, where lost cities such as <span class="highlight">The Lost City Of Atlantis</span> vanished beneath the ocean waves.
          Or monstrous <span class="highlight">leviathans</span> would crush mighty ships without any warning.
          Shipwrecks would often have mysterys surrounding them. mysterys hidden away never to be known in the mass graveyards of sailors.
          For most people these are hoax's and old wives tales.
        </p>
        <p><span class="highlight">But who knows these tales may be real</span></p>
