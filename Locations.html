            Reaching shipwrecks—especially those near coastlines or in remote locations.
            will requir a lot of careful planning and attention to safety. 
            Accessibility can vary widely depending on the terrain, weather, and tide. 
            Some wrecks are easily reached by foot during low tide or found stranded on beaches, 
            while others may require off-road vehicles, boats, or even hiking through rugged terrain. 
            Safety is a major concern, as shipwrecks often contain sharp, rusted metal, unstable structures, or slippery surfaces. 
            Sudden changes in tides, strong currents, or harsh weather can also create dangerous conditions, particularly around coastal or partially submerged wrecks. 
            It is essential to wear proper footwear, check local tide times, and never explore alone. 
            Additionally, environmental and wildlife risks—like jellyfish, sharp rocks, or nesting birds—should be considered. 
            Responsible exploration includes being prepared, respecting warning signs, and never putting curiosity ahead of personal safety.
